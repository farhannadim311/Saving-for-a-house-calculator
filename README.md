# Saving for a House Calculator

This repository contains the solution to the MIT 6.100L problem set focused on saving for a house. The project is divided into three parts:

## Part A: Basic Savings Calculation
- Calculates the number of months required to save for a house down payment based on user inputs.
- Considers a fixed salary and savings rate.
- Filename: `savings_calculator_basic.py`

## Part B: Savings with Salary Raise
- Extends the basic calculation to include semi-annual salary raises.
- Provides a more realistic savings plan with salary growth over time.
- Filename: `savings_calculator_with_raise.py`

## Part C: Optimal Interest Rate Calculation
- Uses bisection search to find the optimal interest rate needed to achieve the down payment goal within three years.
- Incorporates compound interest calculations and iterative approximation.
- Filename: `optimal_interest_rate.py`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `savings_calculator_basic.py`, `savings_calculator_with_raise.py`, and `optimal_interest_rate.py` to see the different parts of the project in action.
3. Follow the prompts to input your financial details.
